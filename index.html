		<h1>Hello world... this is my first website!</h1>
		<h3>Welcome to the Big Lake Club</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="main" class="row">	
		<div class="textbox">
			<p>Over the course of Winter 2015 / 2016, I'm going to use this site as a place to put my rudimentary html, css and js to the test. Hopefully, it also proves a worthwhile reason for me to go out and learn more.</p>
			<p>It's very easy now to take a course on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">codeacademy</a> or <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">udacity</a>. While this may be an effective way for others to learn how applications and code work (they are certainly great resources), I have found that these courses, taken alone, do a bit too much "hand-holding" to be useful to me. I certainly need some hand-holding, but I don't think I'll be able to truly understand how programming works until I've made something myself.</p>
			<h4>What is this site for?</h4>
			<p>I'll be using this site as a place to share several things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>My ongoing adventures in the world of programming / app developing, which fall under the category of "What I'm making"</li>
				<li>Things I've read that I find interesting, or "What I'm reading"</li>
				<li>Food I'm eating, or "What I'm eating"</li>
			</ul>

				<h2>What I'm making</h2>
				<h4>Domain name</h4>
				<p>(15 Dec 2015) First step was to find a domain name. Growing up, my family used to rent a cabin in Chocorua, New Hampshire for a couple of weeks every summer. Mt. Chocorua is an incredibly photogenic peak in the White Mountains of northern New England. At the foot of the mountain is Lake Chocorua. A small wood bridge, wide enough for one car and maybe 15 feet in length, divides the lake in two: a "big lake" and a small one. The small lake offered a more intimate swimming environment while the big one offered opportunies for kayaking adventures and the promise of "white caps" on particularly windy days. For whatever reason, these memories along with the name's brevity made it seem an appropriate choice.</p>
				<p>You can reserve domain names at any number of sites, the most popular of which is probably <a href="www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy.com</a> (known to most for provocative super bowl ads / Danica Patrick). For whatever domain you choose, the offer the .endings available (which come with different price tags). .com or .org were not available, which was fine as non-standard endings are <a href="www.improbable.io">all the rage now</a> anyways. I haven't quite figured out why specifically the ".club" part yet - if you're reading this, you're in the club.</p>
				<h4>Hosting</h4>
				<p>(16 Dec 2015) Github will host pages themselves, which is relatively easy and free. There was a big of head-scratching in linking it to the custom domain name (otherwise you'd have to access this site through fwrv.github.io). Big thanks to Lucas for helping me sort it out. I imagine it isn't the last time I go to him for advice on this adventure.</p>
				<h4>Code editing</h4>
				<p>(18 Dec 2015) I'm using Sublime Text. It's a pleasure to work with and was very straightforward to download. I was a bit surprised when it asked for a $70 registration fee. Over time, I hope to figure out what the various text colors mean.</p>
				<h4>Linking in the CSS</h4>
				<p>(20 Dec 2015) CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that tells the site how it should look. By controlling style decisions from a separate code file (in a different language), decisions I make from font color to general layout are implemented throughout the html doc. Of course, this requires me including a link in the html doc that references the css. This took a fair amount of tinkering and cursing. It took a while for me to understand how to link across files saved locally but in different folders.</p>
				<h4>Learning CSS</h4>
				<p>(23 Dec 2015) This is clearly an ongoing process that very clever people have turned into an art. Here I actually did take the first 2/3 of a quick <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud304">Intro to HTML and CSS</a> course on Udacity. This taught me some fundamentals around box / grid structure of websites and some cool tricks around optimising across platforms, etc. CSS is clearly a bit of a rabbit hole though and I want to start playing around in javascript.</p>
				<h4>Alerts / buttons</h4>
				<p>(10 Feb 2016) So far, I've done next to nothing with javascript on this site itself. To experience for yourself the extent of what <em>has</em> been incorporated, press this button:  <button id="myBtn">Click me</button></p>
				<h4>AngularJS</h4>
				<p>(16 Jan 2016) Following the hearty recommendations of several friends, I started learning <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular JS</a> as a way to incorporate some javescript into this app (aka this page - reader's note: I have learned to call this website an "app" or a "web app". Apparently all websites are indeeds applications.) Angular JS is a much-heralded project from google that allows developers to incorporate javascript seemlessly into html applications. I had this incorporated into the main js script linked to app but I've taken it out while I spend more time experimenting in standard js.</p>
				<h4>Linking within the biglake.club domain</h4>
				<p>(16 Jan 2016) Ultimately I want this site (/"app") to be able to show more than one screen (i.e. I want people to be able to click around in it and be taken to different content). After consulting my lead consultant Lucas, I learned this is actually pretty straightforward. By adding a new .html file to the github repositiory and putting a simple "a href" link in the text, I can add essentially different versions of the same page that the visitor can visit / "surf to". Right now that link wouldn't take you anywhere very impressive. I want to build out the core index.html as well as possible before copying so that future changes won't require me duplicating too much work.</p>
				<h4>Jumping around this main page</h4>
				<p>(12 Feb 2016) What I <em>have</em> built in is the functionality for you, the visitor, to hop around the homepage freely. This is actually the same as above, the "a href" links to a "name" I've put on one of the three main content divs (with a "#" in front, how trendy hehe). The three buttons above are linked to the three corresponding headings for the pages content.</p>
				<h4>Converting this site's content into JS objects and eventually JSON files</h4>
				<p>(Talking the talk on 12 Feb 2016, walking the walk soon) The "great leap forward" for this site will be when content can be displayed / modified in a modular and scalable way. Right now, the site you are looking at is one long html file. (If you're using a chrome browser, you can right-click/control-click on the screen, hit "Inspect", and see the code for yourself.) Each update that I make, I type into the same file. This is increasingly untenable as the number of updates grows - most importantly, it's <em>inelegant!</em></p>
				<p>As a key part of my javascript education, I've been learing about <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-objects-in-detail/">objects</a>. Within the context of js, an object is a "complex" data type, as opposed to numbers or strings of text, which are "simple" data types. Objects are useful in that they can take on multiple properties. For example, a smartphone-contact object could contain the properties of a person's name, their number and their email address. Curating an array (or list) of objects all with similar (or overlapping) properties allows you to list or search within quite easily (using "for" loops, among other nifty tricks).</p>
				<p>The next step, then, for this site/project is to convert the content posts into objects, each with a set of properties. The common properties as I've laid them out include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Title</li>
					<li>Date posted</li>
					<li>Tag (i.e. whether it counts as "making", "reading", or "eating")</li>
					<li>Summary (a one sentence description which can be displayed in an index or TOC)</li>
					<li>Author (for a future scenario in which the BLC may contain kind outside contributors)</li>
					<li>Content (i.e. the post itself)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>When the content lives in the form of js objects, it will free the index.html page (and other html sub-pages, as I make them) from housing all the content in the same doc. You, the viewer, will be able to search and sort content by tag, date or author or even browse by summary. The entire content process will become more modular and I'll be able to abstract fundamental app changes without getting ensnared by a long thorny html file. It is the future and it is exciting.</p>
				<p>However, this can be improved upon still further! You may notice a shortcoming of the plan so far: By turning content posts into js objects in a single array I may be taking them out of the html file, but I'm only just moving them all into a js one. This is where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> comes in. JSON, or "JavaScript Object Notation" is a format and file type that will allow me to create content posts as independant files with the same data parameters that I would feed into the objects in my standard js file. I haven't fully gotten my head around this yet - but the idea is that each of the content posts would live as its own file in my github repository and my main BLscript.js file would reference them as described above.</p>
				<p>These changes will bring about a brave new world for the members of the Big Lake Club. I'll be providing unsolicited updates as I go along.</p>

				<h2>What I'm reading</h2>
				<p>[Work in progress - you can see my Goodreads acccount <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41286311-fernando-rodriguez-villa">here</a>.]</p>
				<p>(02 Feb 2016): <a href="http://redef.com/original/age-of-abundance-how-the-content-explosion-will-invert-the-media-industry">"Age of Abundance"</a> by Tal Shachar and Liam Boluk goes on a thoughtful exploration of the implications of both a) "ubiquitious content" and b) its new methods of distribution for the media industry. It's worth reading in its entirety but at the very least you should check out these two images:</p>
				<h4>"The Historical Value Chain"</h4>
				<img src="https://d2dpa77enk4uif.cloudfront.net/app/uploads/20160116211911/REDEF_Curation_1.1.png" alt="Value Chain before" style="width:75%">
				<h4>"The Modern Value Chain"</h4>
				<img src="https://d2dpa77enk4uif.cloudfront.net/app/uploads/20160116211913/REDEF_Curation_1.5.png" alt="Value Chain after" style="width:75%">
				<p>Interesting meta-point: This article was recommended to me in a regular newsletter (Azeem Azhar's <em>very good</em> <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/azeem?utm_campaign=Issue&utm_content=profileimage&utm_medium=email&utm_source=issue">"The Exponential View"</a>), having been selected from a wide range of content that was recommended to <em>him</em> by his readers (and perhaps a small amount of personal reading). I'd never heard of <a href="http://redef.com/channel/media">REDEF</a>, the traditional "distributor" before, nor will I necessarily look directly to that distributor again. Is the <em>real</em> distributor here Azeem, the reader that recommended the piece to him, or <em>me</em>, the person who has shared the content now with <em>you</em>, the audience (i.e. the friend or family member humoring me by checking out this site)? No one involved has had any relationship with the "creatives" of the content (which, at least in my case, is a shame, since they seem like clever guys). While this phenomenon is potentially exciting for them, it also highlights their lack of control. In any case, plenty more to dig into here.</p>
				<p>(12 Feb 2016): <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/542951/business-models-information-technology-and-the-company-of-the-future/">"Business Models, Information Technology, and the Company of the Future"</a> by Stanford's Haim Mendelson showed up this morning in the daily newsletter from the MIT tech review (the piece was originally published in Oct 2015). The heady title gives a sense of what to expect from the piece, which is long on MBA-lingo and short on real-world examples / applications. (Seriously though, this is an actual quote: "The combined effect of mobile technologies, wearable devices and sensors, cloud computing, and big data technologies will sharpen the structure of future business models." Say what? <em>No way!</em>) That being said (and as pejorative as I made "MBA-lingo" sound just now), I found the following interesting:</p>
				<div class="quotebox">
					<p>Three technologies will play a particularly important role in the use of IT:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><em>Customer-intimacy agents</em> will be customers digital representatives in the marketplace, using data to find and solicit solutions that will make them better off.</li>
						<li><em>Value-chain coordinators</em> will match supply and demand, assemble customized solutions, and engage in electronic customer data-driven innovation.</li>
						<li><em>Producers</em> will increasingly engage in marketplace selling and data-driven innovation.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>These three technologies seem to fit along a continuum of being customer facing vs. enterprise facing. "Customer-intimacy agents" purport to be actively champion-ing (even anticipating) the needs/desires of the customer/user. An example of this could be (my employer) <a href="www.knewton.com">Knewton</a>'s adaptive learning technology, which uses student proficiency data to cater content to the individual learner's needs and goals (and showing teachers predictive analytics re: student performance).</p>
				<p>"Value-chain coordinators" straddle the best interests of the customer and the enterprise, in theory connecting the one with the best possible services of the other. An obvious example of this would be how Uber uses surge pricing to match ride supply with ride demand. Surge pricing itself is unsustainably punitive and really a manifestation of equilibrium breaking down rather than a triumph of efficiency - it's more of a stop-gap. The victory for "value-chain coordinating" technology will be when Uber can anticipate ride demand so well so that surge pricing wont even take place. Maybe you could debate that Uber would never want its own technology to make surge pricing obsolete but I think users will ultimately be powerful enough that it (Uber) won't have a choice (the power of Uber's users is also why European regulators and cab drivers are fighting a losing battle). This anticipatory tech would be far easier to implement when cars go driver-less. (For another example: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2014/01/28/why-amazons-anticipatory-shipping-is-pure-genius/#4cf4f2b92fac">see</a> how Amazon is stocking it's "fulfillment centers" similarly to anticipate customer/user demand.</p>
				<p>Mendelson's last category is also probably the most boring as it's already the most prevalant. Producers are selling into an increasingly flat market (see the post on ubiquitous/accessible content above) where intimate knowledge of their end users (and use cases) is imperative both for differentiation and innovation.</p>
				<p>For all the drivel (Mendelson's and mine), I think there is actually good food for thought here. I also realise that I'm offering my opinion to you (my accommodating friend or family member) without giving you a chance to respond. There are many improvements to be made to this site (from typos/grammar to its "1990's feel" to its fundamental structure) - hopefully some feedback functionality will be available soon. In the meantime, you can always tweet at me @frodriguezvilla.</p>

				<h2>What I'm eating</h2>
				<p>[Very much work in progress, some content below.]</p>
				<p>If I'm in London, chances are I'm eating <a href="http://meatmission.com/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/">here</a>, or <a href="http://www.homeslicepizza.co.uk/menu/">here</a>.</p>
				<p>If I were asked to rank my favorite <a href="http://www.homeslicepizza.co.uk/">Homeslice</a> pizzas, I'd probably say:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Chorizo, Corn & "Coriander" (a.k.a. Cilantro)</li>
					<li>Salami, Rocket & Parmesan</li>
					<li>Goat Shoulder</li>
					<li>Aubergine, Cauliflower, Spinach & Harissa</li>
				</ol>
				<p>That being said, I think it's worth dedicating 1/2 a pizza every trip to trying new flavors (i.e. being "mostly greedy"). (Shout out to former roommate Ian's <a href="http://iosband.github.io/2015/07/19/Efficient-experimentation-and-multi-armed-bandits.html">very helpful walk-through</a> of learning algorythms and the multi-armed bandit.)</p>
