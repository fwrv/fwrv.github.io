		<h1>Hello world... this is my first website!</h1>
		<h3>Welcome to the Big Lake Club</h3>

			<p>Over the course of this winter (2015/2016), I'm going to be using this as a place to put my rudimentary html, css and js to the test. Hopefully, this also proves a worthwhile reason for me to go out and learn more.</p>
			<p>It's very easy now to take a course on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">codeacademy</a> or <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">udacity</a>. While this may be an effective way for others to learn how applications and code work (they are certainly great resources), I have found that these courses, taken alone, do a bit too much "hand-holding" for my liking. I certainly need some hand-holding, but I don't think I'll be able to truly understand how programming works until I've made something myself.</p>
			<h4>What else is this site for?</h4>
			<p>I'll be using this site as a place to show several things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>My ongoing adventures in the world of programming / app developing, which fall under the category of "What I'm making"</li>
				<li>Things I've read that I find interesting, or "What I'm reading"</li>
				<li>Food I'm eating, or "What I'm eating"</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Domain name</h4>
			<p>First step was to find a domain name. Growing up, my family used to rent a cabin in Chocorua, New Hampshire for a couple of weeks every summer. Mt. Chocorua is an incredibly photogenic peak in the White Mountains of northern New England. At the foot of the mountain is Lake Chocorua. A small wood bridge, wide enough for one car and maybe 15 feet in length, divides the lake in two: a "big lake" and a small one. You can probably see where this is going... our family referred to the two as the "big lake" and "small lake." It may be harder to see why all this made me think biglake was a cool domain name, but I think it'll certainly do.</p>
			<p>I haven't quite figured out the ".club" part yet... It was my favorite of the ones available on godaddy.com. If you're reading this, you're in the club.</p>
			<h4 class="topic">Hosting</h4>
			<p>Github pages, (relatively) easy and free. Big thanks to Lucas for helping me link it to the custom domain name. I imagine it isn't the last time I go to him for advice on this adventure.</p>
			<h4>Code editing</h4>
			<p>I'm using Sublime Text. It's a pleasure to work in and was very straightforward to download. I was a bit surprised when it asked for a $70 registration fee. Over time, I hope to figure out what the various text colors mean.</p>
			<h4>Linking in the CSS</h4>
			<p>This took a fair amount of tinkering and cursing. I didn't quite understand how to link to other files saved locally but in different folders. </p>
			<h4>Learning CSS</h4>
			<p>This is clearly an ongoing process that very clever people have turned into an art. Here I actually did take the first 2/3 of a quick <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud304">Intro to HTML and CSS</a> course on Udacity. This taught me some fundamentals around box / grid structure of websites and some cool tricks around optimising across platforms, etc. CSS is clearly a bit of a rabbit hole though and I want to start playing around in javascript.</p>
			<h4>AngularJS</h4>
			<p>Following the hearty recommendations of several friends, I'm learning <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular JS</a> as a way to incorporate some javescript into this app (aka this page - reader's note: I have learned to call this website an "app" or a "web app". Apparently all websites are indeeds applications.) Angular JS is a much-heralded project from google that allows developers to incorporate javescript seemlessly into html applications. As of me adding this text, biglake.club now incoporates Angular... it just isn't using it much yet.</p>
			<h4>Linking within the biglake.club domain</h4>
			<p>Ultimately I want this site (/"app") to be able to show more than one screen (i.e. I want people to be able to click around in it and be taken to different content). After consulting my lead consultant Lucas, I learned this is actually pretty straightforward. By adding a new .html file to the github repositiory and putting a simple "a href" link in the text, I can add essentially different versions of the same page that the visitor can visit / "surf to". You'll see the link on "What I'm making" header above does just that, as does <a href="/making.html">THIS</a> text. (Right now the link doesn't take you anywhere very impressive, but I want to build out the core index.html as well as possible before copying so that future changes won't require me duplicating too much work.)</p>
