		<h1>Hello world... this is my first website!</h1>
		<h3>Welcome to the Big Lake Club</h3>

			<p>Over the course of Winter 2015 / 2016, I'm going to be using this site as a place to put my rudimentary html, css and js to the test. Hopefully, it also proves a worthwhile reason for me to go out and learn more.</p>
			<p>It's very easy now to take a course on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">codeacademy</a> or <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">udacity</a>. While this may be an effective way for others to learn how applications and code work (they are certainly great resources), I have found that these courses, taken alone, do a bit too much "hand-holding" to be useful to me. I certainly need some hand-holding, but I don't think I'll be able to truly understand how programming works until I've made something myself.</p>
			<h4>What is this site for?</h4>
			<p>I'll be using this site as a place to share several things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>My ongoing adventures in the world of programming / app developing, which fall under the category of "What I'm making"</li>
				<li>Things I've read that I find interesting, or "What I'm reading"</li>
				<li>Food I'm eating, or "What I'm eating"</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Domain name</h4>
			<p>First step was to find a domain name. Growing up, my family used to rent a cabin in Chocorua, New Hampshire for a couple of weeks every summer. Mt. Chocorua is an incredibly photogenic peak in the White Mountains of northern New England. At the foot of the mountain is Lake Chocorua. A small wood bridge, wide enough for one car and maybe 15 feet in length, divides the lake in two: a "big lake" and a small one. You can probably see where this is going... our family referred to the two as the "big lake" and "small lake." It may be harder to see why all this made me think biglake was a cool domain name, but I think it'll certainly do.</p>
			<p>I haven't quite figured out the ".club" part yet... It was my favorite of the ones available on godaddy.com. If you're reading this, you're in the club.</p>
			<h4 class="topic">Hosting</h4>
			<p>Github pages, (relatively) easy and free. Big thanks to Lucas for helping me link it to the custom domain name. I imagine it isn't the last time I go to him for advice on this adventure.</p>
			<h4>Code editing</h4>
			<p>I'm using Sublime Text. It's a pleasure to work in and was very straightforward to download. I was a bit surprised when it asked for a $70 registration fee. Over time, I hope to figure out what the various text colors mean.</p>
			<h4>Linking in the CSS</h4>
			<p>This took a fair amount of tinkering and cursing. I didn't quite understand how to link to other files saved locally but in different folders. </p>
			<h4>Learning CSS</h4>
			<p>This is clearly an ongoing process that very clever people have turned into an art. Here I actually did take the first 2/3 of a quick <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud304">Intro to HTML and CSS</a> course on Udacity. This taught me some fundamentals around box / grid structure of websites and some cool tricks around optimising across platforms, etc. CSS is clearly a bit of a rabbit hole though and I want to start playing around in javascript.</p>
			<h4>AngularJS</h4>
			<p>Following the hearty recommendations of several friends, I'm learning <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular JS</a> as a way to incorporate some javescript into this app (aka this page - reader's note: I have learned to call this website an "app" or a "web app". Apparently all websites are indeeds applications.) Angular JS is a much-heralded project from google that allows developers to incorporate javescript seemlessly into html applications. As of me adding this text, biglake.club now incoporates Angular... it just isn't using it much yet.</p>
			<h4>Linking within the biglake.club domain</h4>
			<p>Ultimately I want this site (/"app") to be able to show more than one screen (i.e. I want people to be able to click around in it and be taken to different content). After consulting my lead consultant Lucas, I learned this is actually pretty straightforward. By adding a new .html file to the github repositiory and putting a simple "a href" link in the text, I can add essentially different versions of the same page that the visitor can visit / "surf to". You'll see the link on "What I'm making" header above does just that, as does <a href="/making.html">THIS</a> text. (Right now the link doesn't take you anywhere very impressive, but I want to build out the core index.html as well as possible before copying so that future changes won't require me duplicating too much work.)</p>
			<h2>What I'm reading</h2>
			<p>[Basically TBD - but you can see my Goodreads acccount <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41286311-fernando-rodriguez-villa">here</a>.]</p>
			<p><strong>02 Feb 2016:</strong> <a href="http://redef.com/original/age-of-abundance-how-the-content-explosion-will-invert-the-media-industry">This piece</a> by Tal Shachar and Liam Boluk goes on a thoughtful exploration of the implications of both a) "ubiquitious content" and b) its new methods of distribution for the media industry. It's worth reading in its entirety but at the very least you should check out these two images:</p>
			<h4>"The Historical Value Chain"</h4>
			<img src="https://d2dpa77enk4uif.cloudfront.net/app/uploads/20160116211911/REDEF_Curation_1.1.png" alt="Value Chain before" style="width:75%">
			<h4>"The Modern Value Chain"</h4>
			<img src="https://d2dpa77enk4uif.cloudfront.net/app/uploads/20160116211913/REDEF_Curation_1.5.png" alt="Value Chain after" style="width:75%">
			<p>Interesting meta-point: This article was recommended to me in a regular newsletter (Azeem Azhar's <em>very good</em> <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/azeem?utm_campaign=Issue&utm_content=profileimage&utm_medium=email&utm_source=issue">"The Exponential View"</a>), having been selected from a wide range of content that was recommended to <em>him</em> by his readers (and perhaps a small amount of personal reading). I'd never heard of <a href="http://redef.com/channel/media">REDEF</a>, the traditional "distributor" before, nor will I necessarily look directly to that distributor again. Is the <em>real</em> distributor here Azeem, the reader that recommended the piece to him, or <em>me</em>, the person who has shared the content now with <em>you</em>, the audience (i.e. the friend or family member humoring me by checking out this site)? No one involved has had any relationship with the "creatives" of the content (which, at least in my case, is a shame, since they seem like clever guys). While this phenomenon is potentially exciting for them, it also highlights their lack of control. In any case, plenty more to dig into here.</p>
			<h2>What I'm eating</h2>
			<p>[Very much work in progress, some content below.]</p>
			<p>If I'm in London, chances are I'm eating <a href="http://meatmission.com/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/">here</a>, or <a href="http://www.homeslicepizza.co.uk/menu/">here</a>.</p>
			<p>If I were asked to rank my favorite <a href="http://www.homeslicepizza.co.uk/">Homselice</a> pizzas, I'd probably say:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Chorizo, Corn & "Coriander" (a.k.a. Oregano)</li>
				<li>Salami, Rocket & Parmesan</li>
				<li>Goat Shoulder</li>
				<li>Aubergine, Cauliflower, Spinach & Harissa</li>
			</ol>
			<p>That being said, I think it's worth dedicating 1/2 a pizza every trip to trying new flavors (i.e. being "mostly greedy"). (Shout out to former roommate Ian's <a href="http://iosband.github.io/2015/07/19/Efficient-experimentation-and-multi-armed-bandits.html">very helpful walk-through</a> of learning algorythms and the multi-armed bandit.)</p>
