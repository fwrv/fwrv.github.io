	<h1>Hello world... this is my first website!</h1>
	<p>Over the course of this winter break (December 2015), I'm going to be using this as a place to put my rudimentary html, css and js to the test. Hopefully, this also proves a worthwhile reason for me to go out and learn more.</p>
	<p>It's very easy now to take a course on codeacademy or udacity. While this may be an effective way for others to learn how applications and code work (it is certainly an admirable one), I have found that these courses, taken alone, do a bit too much "hand-holding" for my liking. I certainly need some hand-holding, but I don't think I'll be able to truly understand how programming works until I've made something myself.</p>
	<h4>Domain name</h4>
	<p>First step was to find a domain name. Growing up, my family used to rent a cabin in Chocorua, New Hampshire for a couple weeks every summer. Mt. Chocorua is an incredibly photogenic peak in the White Mountains of northern New England. At the foot of the mountain is Lake Chocorua. A small wood bridge, wide enough for one car and maybe 15 feet in length, divides the lake in two, a "big lake" and a small one. You can probably see where this is going... our family referred to the two as the "big lake" and "small lake." It may be harder to see why all this made me think biglake was a cool domain name, but I think it'll certainly do.</p>
	<p>I haven't quite figured out the ".club" part yet... It was my favorite of the ones available on godaddy.com</p>
	<h4>Hosting</h4>
	<p>Github pages, (relatively) easy and free. Big thanks to Lucas for helping me link it to the custom domain name. I imagine it isn't the last time I go to him for advice on this adventure.</p>
